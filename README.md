# Transportation
It was step-by-step huge project from it-simulator.com, but I stopped it to try some simplier projects by myself.

Used technologies: 
__IDE: Eclipse (EclEmma plugin, Tomcat plugin);
__Testing:JUnit, JMockit;
__Build: Maven -> Gradle;
__FrontEnd: JSON, Angular;
__REST\JSON lib: Jersey;
__CI: Jenkins;
__WebServer: Tomcat;
__Logging: log4j;
__Monitor: JMeter;
